## 0.6.5

### Patch Changes

- 57906b3: Pi harness skill mounting strategies (`skill_mount`: `progressive` default, `budgeted`, `tool`, `inline`) replace default full SKILL.md system-prompt inlining for default/Pi harnesses. Deferred skills in `budgeted` mode are discoverable via `tool_search`; `tool` mode adds a `skill` loader tool.

## 0.6.4

### Patch Changes

- 38f58cb: Pi agent-core is the default harness; legacy `ai-sdk` remains available but deprecated (one-time `session.warning` per session). Agents accept compaction via `_oma.context_management` (Anthropic Messages shape) or `_oma.model_settings` (OpenAI Agents SDK shape); conflicting dual definitions are rejected at save time. MCP tool results preserve content blocks on the wire. Agent `max_tokens` above the catalog window is accepted with a warning; pi-ai clamps output per request.
- 2f7c08d: Document agent metadata for deferred MCP `tool_search`: `tool_search` (`auto` | `on` | `off`, default `auto`), optional `tool_search_limit`, `tool_search_auto_threshold`, and `tool_search_always_load`. Backward compatible — omitting `tool_search` keeps automatic exposure when MCP tool definitions exceed a fraction of the model context window.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 7d3bbf5: Emit `bundle_dir` and `fresh` on `session.ready` after a fresh ACP spawn so the cloud harness can locate the platform bundle without guessing scratch paths.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 6a5c715: Honor an optional session.start cwd as the ACP process directory while writing the bundle to the daemon scratch directory.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- a011976: Prevent idle sleep while the local daemon is available, release the power assertion during shutdown, and retry unavailable platform helpers without interrupting tasks.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 68d2772: Align CLI requests with the Managed Agents and OMA API namespaces, and run daemon sessions through the shared managed runtime.

### Patch Changes

- 7629a91: Expose typed Model Card management and Pi provider metadata through the SDK,
  align model catalog discovery across Node and Cloudflare, and document the
  runtime semantics of effort, speed, and custom Pi model configuration.
- f0c9aed: Preserve ACP completion token usage when relaying sessions and return the complete agents page in JSON mode, including empty results and pagination metadata.
- fc24017: Include the underlying network error code in CLI fetch failures.
- 2b6f7bf: Update the shared runtime so ACP sessions can start without the optional steering extension. Reject unsupported active-turn steering at invocation instead of blocking ordinary prompts.
- 2b6f7bf: Consume the versioned OpenMA common local runtime for ACP sessions, connection lifecycle and owned-host shutdown. Keep CLI credentials, signals and filesystem adapters outside the shared kernel.
- 2b6f7bf: Share daemon connection lifecycle with the desktop host, reconnect silent links without replaying user input, and preserve single execution ownership on attachment conflicts.

  Separate owned daemon drain and cleanup from CLI process signals, preserve the output connection until sessions finish, reject new turns during shutdown, and report shutdown failures after cleanup.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- aecc66e: Send bridge setup requests directly to the app origin so the runtime exchange POST is not rewritten by an apex redirect.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#103](https://github.com/openma-ai/open-managed-agents/pull/103) [`85c2e1c`](https://github.com/openma-ai/open-managed-agents/commit/85c2e1c359f774a3dbafcc45a6e7875ebba55ff2) Thanks [@hrhrng](https://github.com/hrhrng)! - `oma bridge` daemon now serves multiple tenants from a single process.
  One daemon is authorized for every workspace the user is a member of;
  each spawned ACP child gets the per-tenant `oma_*` key matching the
  session's workspace.
  - `oma bridge setup` requests the multi-tenant `/exchange` shape and
    writes a `CredentialsV2` file (`{v:2, tenants:[…], …}`). Old v1
    creds files (`agentApiKey` at the top level) auto-migrate on next
    daemon start — calls `GET /agents/runtime/me` to pull the tenant
    list, falls back to a placeholder workspace if the server is
    unreachable so the daemon still runs offline.
  - `oma bridge refresh` (new) re-syncs the daemon's credentials with
    the user's current memberships. Adds keys for new workspaces, soft-
    revokes keys for removed ones, then `SIGHUP`s the running daemon
    so the change takes effect without a restart.
  - `SessionManager` looks up the right `oma_*` key per session by the
    inbound `session.start`'s `tenant_id`. Every outbound message the
    daemon sends carries `tenant_id` so the server can validate it
    against the runtime's authorized set.

  Backward-compatible: v1 daemons keep working against the new server
  shape (server returns the legacy `{runtime_id, token, agent_api_key}`
  when the request doesn't set `multi_tenant: true`). The workaround
  for multi-tenant — running multiple `OMA_PROFILE=…` daemons side by
  side — still works for separate server environments.

### Patch Changes

- [`31f7fbf`](https://github.com/openma-ai/open-managed-agents/commit/31f7fbf67305f44831a379d9149bcf0c6a8d9c00) Thanks [@hrhrng](https://github.com/hrhrng)! - `oma bridge setup` now exits cleanly after "Done." instead of hanging
  for ~5 minutes on idle keep-alive HTTP sockets from the registry CDN
  fetch and the runtime-token probe. Daemon was already started by
  launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler — only the foreground setup process
  itself was waiting on the undici dispatcher to time out its sockets.
  Force-exits at end of runSetup, matching how npm / pnpm / gh handle
  the same constraint in their CLI commands.

  Adds an opt-in `OMA_DEBUG_HANDLES=1` env var that prints active
  handles + requests every 2s — useful for diagnosing future "process
  won't exit" regressions without redeploying.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#41](https://github.com/openma-ai/open-managed-agents/pull/41) [`e370a4a`](https://github.com/openma-ai/open-managed-agents/commit/e370a4ab550ca18a37e27761695fb9bbd2e8bdb7) Thanks [@hrhrng](https://github.com/hrhrng)! - `oma bridge setup` now exits cleanly after "Done." instead of hanging

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4df9a0e`](https://github.com/openma-ai/open-managed-agents/commit/4df9a0e677eb1712688134fc140edb6d0db3969a) Thanks [@hrhrng](https://github.com/hrhrng)! - Bridge: expand local ACP agent support to the full official registry,
  add cross-platform service install (launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler,
  all no-admin), and wire end-to-end conversation recovery so daemon
  restarts no longer drop context. `oma bridge setup` is now the single
  command on every platform — installs the system service, starts the
  daemon, and audits + offers ACP wrappers for install (npm packages or
  GitHub release tarballs). Includes `OMA_PROFILE` for prod/staging
  side-by-side daemons (default behavior unchanged for current users).

  Fixes a multi-profile bug where the launchd-spawned daemon silently
  dropped `OMA_PROFILE` and read the default profile's credentials,
  causing the "wrong" daemon to compete for the WS attach slot.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`018b647`](https://github.com/openma-ai/open-managed-agents/commit/018b647536eb5d1398510fcc37f6c65447a801fd) Thanks [@hrhrng](https://github.com/hrhrng)! - Add Bridge subcommand section to top-level `oma` help so `setup`, `daemon`,
  `status`, `uninstall` are discoverable without grepping or guessing.
