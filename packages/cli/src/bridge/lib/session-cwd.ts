/**
 * Per-session working directory management.
 *
 * The scratch dir is always `~/.oma/bridge/sessions/<session-id>/`. The
 * OMA-rendered bundle (AGENTS.md + skill files) lands there before each
 * session.start, never in the user's project root.
 *
 * The ACP process cwd is that scratch dir unless `session.start` carries
 * `cwd`. When the platform sends a project directory, the child process
 * starts there and the bundle stays in the scratch dir.
 *
 * Other reasons the scratch dir exists:
 *
 *   1. Isolation. Two parallel sessions don't see each other's transcripts
 *      or tool-call state.
 *   2. Stable transcript paths. Resume-from-disk needs a dir that does not
 *      follow whichever terminal the user ran `npx` from this morning.
 *
 * Lifecycle: dir lifetime is bound to the OMA session. Cleanup happens when
 * the platform tells the daemon `session.dispose` (which fires on
 * `DELETE /v1/sessions/:id`). The daemon does NOT auto-GC by age — leaving
 * a stale dir is preferable to deleting transcripts the user might still
 * want to resume / inspect, and only the platform knows when a session
 * is truly dead.
 *
 * The bundle (AGENTS.md + .claude/skills/...) is fetched per session.start
 * from main's `/agents/runtime/sessions/:sid/bundle?agent_id=...`, NOT
 * bundled into the daemon binary. That keeps prompts / skills owned by
 * the OMA platform per-tenant rather than baked into the npm-published CLI.
